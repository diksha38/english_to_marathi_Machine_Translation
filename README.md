# This code implements a sequence-to-sequence model for English to Marathi translation using LSTM layers, focusing on data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and inference.

1. Imports and Setup: Libraries are imported, data is loaded, cleaned, split into English and Marathi sentences, and preprocessed (lowercasing, removing punctuation and digits).

2. Tokenization and Padding: English and Marathi sentences are tokenized using Keras Tokenizer, dictionaries for word-to-index and index-to-word mappings are created, and sequences are padded to ensure uniform length.

3. Model Definition: Encoder and Decoder classes are defined using LSTM layers for sequence processing, along with functions for calculating loss and accuracy.

4. Training Setup: Data is split into training and testing sets, and TensorFlow Dataset API is used for efficient data handling during training.

5. Training Loop: The model is trained using custom training loops, with gradient computation, optimization, and periodic checkpointing.

6. Inference: A function is defined for inference using the trained model to translate English sentences to Marathi, employing the encoder-decoder architecture with teacher forcing.

7. Example Usage: An example sentence is provided to demonstrate the model's translation capability from English to Marathi.
